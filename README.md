# article-test-3







This repository has:

- (Not yet) Multiple notebooks, with self-contained "Project.tomls", i.e. cells with Pkg.add()
- GH action to create static renders
- Binder button, binder goes to this repository
- GH action to trigger binder build on gke
- GH pages to serve the gh-pages branch at fonsp.com/article-test-3
- Heroku to run the bind server



There is a Project.toml and **important: the Manifest.toml** in this repository containing the exact versions of Pluto.jl and PlutoBindServer.jl that are used in everything. (Needs to be the same everywhere)
